### Proposed Number Pattern: Factorial Prime Positional Sum (FPPS)

1. **Description**:
   This pattern involves primes, factorials, and the sum of positional values of factorials.

2. **Generation**:
   - Start with a sequence of prime numbers: \(p_1, p_2, p_3, \ldots\) (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...).
   - Compute the factorial of each prime number: \(p_1!, p_2!, p_3!, \ldots\).
   - For each factorial result, sum the digits in its positional value (units, tens, hundreds, etc.).
   - The sequence is formed by these sums.

3. **Pattern Illustration**:
   - For the first few primes \(2, 3, 5\), the factorials are \(2!, 3!, 5!\) which are \(2, 6, 120\) respectively.
   - The sum of digits for each factorial value is \(2, 6, 3\) (since \(1 + 2 + 0 = 3\)).

4. **Continuing the Pattern**:
   - Next prime is 7, so \(7! = 5040\), and the sum of its digits is \(5 + 0 + 4 + 0 = 9\).
   - Following that, for 11, \(11! = 39916800\), and the sum of its digits is \(3 + 9 + 9 + 1 + 6 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 36\).

5. **General Formula**:
   Given a prime \(p\), let \(S(p!)\) be the sum of the digits of \(p!\). The sequence can be represented as \(\{S(p_1!), S(p_2!), S(p_3!), \ldots\}\) where \(p_i\) are primes.

### Observations:
- This pattern combines the properties of primes with the growth rate of factorials, further distilled into the sum of their digit's positional values.
- It captures the exponential growth of factorials, the distribution of prime numbers, and the arithmetic properties of their factorial's digits.
- Such a sequence would showcase sporadic behavior, reflecting both the unpredictability of prime distribution and the factorial growth rate.

### Uniqueness and Complexity:
- This pattern is unique in its combination of factorial growth and prime distribution, tied together by the digital root-like process but retaining the original sums.
- The complexity and variety it embodies—spanning prime theory, factorial growth, and digital sum analysis—offer a rich ground for exploration.
